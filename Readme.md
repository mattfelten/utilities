## utilities.css
Main CSS file to give any project boilerplate CSS.

>Utility classes create fast loading, highly readable, and 100% responsive interfaces with as little CSS as possible.

The [Functional CSS philosophy](https://css-tricks.com/lets-define-exactly-atomic-css/) is to create highly atomic CSS classes that can be combined for prototyping without having to write new CSS.

### Example
```html
<p class="w-50 m-x-auto fw-b bs ta-c p-2">Here is an example of using utility classes.<p>
```

### Usage
Import into your project `@import ~utilities/utilities.scss` and reap the rewards!

If you only need the variables, functions, and mixins, you can also only import `_helpers.scss`.
